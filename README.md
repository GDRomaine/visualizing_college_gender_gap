## visualizing_college_gender_gap

In this project, I plot the percentage of college degrees awarded to men and
women in various degree categories against year. The [National Center for
Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/) releases a dataset annually containing the percentage of
bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 onward. The dataset is broken up
into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category. Randal
Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the dataset
and made it available on his [personal website](http://www.randalolson.com/). You can download the dataset
Randal compiled [here](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv).

The motivation behind this project is to showcase my ability to create data
visualizations which effectively communicate the desired information while also
remaining aesthetically pleasing.

Note: throughout the project, I write with plural subject pronouns as opposed
to singular subject pronouns (e.g. "We have" vs. "I have"). Please do not
make the mistake of assuming a team of people were behind this project. I
worked on this project alone. I simply prefer this writing style for data
science projects as it feels more inclusive -- as if you and I are walking
through the project together :)
